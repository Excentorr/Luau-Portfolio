### Automatic Door - automaticDoor.lua

- To use this code, you can create a part for the button in your game and attach a ClickDetector to it. 
- Then, create a script inside the button part and copy and paste the code into the script. When the player clicks on the button in the game, the doors will open and then close again after a 2 second interval.
- Create 2 doors beside eachother, and make sure they have the same width. Name the door on the left, "door1" and the door on the right "door2", for the code to work.

### NPC Finds End of Maze - pathfindingNPC.lua

- To use this code, create a maze or a path that you want the NPC to travel through
- Create a part and name it "EndPoint", and place it at the end of the maze or route you created for the NPC
- Now insert a NPC, and create a script inside the NPC and copy and paste the code into the script.

### Turret - turret.lua

- To use this code, create a part in your game and name it "Turret". Inside the "Turret" part, create another part and name it "Barrel".
- Then, create a model in ReplicatedStorage and name it "Bullet". This model should contain a part representing the bullet.
- When you run the game, the turret will continuously check for nearby players within a 200 stud radius. If a player is detected, the turret will rotate its barrel towards the player and shoot a bullet in their direction.
