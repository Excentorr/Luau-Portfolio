## Welcome to My Lua Portfolio! 

This repository houses a collection of programs designed to learn various services within Roblox Lua. 

Below, you'll find concise descriptions and instructions on how to use each program included in this repository. 

Feel free to customize the code to fit your specific needs!

### Automatic Door - automaticDoor.lua

- To use this code, you can create a part in your game and attach a ClickDetector to it. 
- Then, create a script inside the part and copy and paste the code into the script. When the player clicks on the part in the game, the doors will open and then close again after a 2 second interval.

### NPC Finds End of Maze - pathfindingNPC.lua



### Turret - turret.lua

- To use this code, create a part in your game and name it "Turret". Inside the "Turret" part, create another part and name it "Barrel".
- Then, create a model in ReplicatedStorage and name it "Bullet". This model should contain a part representing the bullet.
- When you run the game, the turret will continuously check for nearby players within a 200 stud radius. If a player is detected, the turret will rotate its barrel towards the player and shoot a bullet in their direction.
